phonogram |1. A letter, character, or mark used to represent a particular sound. Phonograms are of three kinds: (1) Verbal signs, which stand for entire words; (2) Syllabic signs, which stand for the articulations of which words are composed; (3) Alphabetic signs, or letters, which represent the elementary sounds into which the syllable can be resolved. I. Taylor (The Alphabet). 2. A record of sounds made by a phonograph.
phonograph |1. A character or symbol used to represent a sound, esp. one used in phonography. 2. (Physics)  An instrument for the mechanical registration and reproduction of audible sounds, as articulate speech, etc. It consists of a rotating cylinder or disk covered with some material easily indented, as tinfoil, wax, paraffin, etc., above which is a thin plate carrying a stylus. As the plate vibrates under the influence of a sound, the stylus makes minute indentations or undulations in the soft material, and these, when the cylinder or disk is again turned, set the plate in vibration, and reproduce the sound.
