The rest of the year was called vacation. But this division has been practically abolished by the Judicature Acts of 1873, 1875, which provide for the more convenient arrangement of the terms and vacations. In the United States, the terms to be observed by the tribunals of justice are prescribed by the statutes of Congress and of the several States. 6. (Logic)  The subject or the predicate of a proposition; one of the three component parts of a syllogism, each one of which is used twice. The subject and predicate of a proposition are, after Aristotle, together called its terms or extremes. Sir W. Hamilton. Note: The predicate of the conclusion is called the major term, because it is the most general, and the subject of the conclusion is called the minor term, because it is less general. These are called the extermes; and the third term, introduced as a common measure between them, is called the mean or middle term. Thus in the following syllogism, --Every vegetable is combustible; Every tree is a vegetable; Therefore every tree is combustible, -combustible, the predicate of the conclusion, is the major term; tree is the minor term; vegetable is the middle term. 7.

Syn. -- Limit; bound; boundary; condition; stipulation; word; expression. -- Term, Word. These are more frequently interchanged than almost any other vocables that occur of the language. There is, however, a difference between them which is worthy of being kept in mind. Word is generic; it denotes an utterance which represents or expresses our thoughts and feelings. Term originally denoted one of the two essential members of a proposition in logic, and hence signifies a word of specific meaning, and applicable to a definite class of objects. Thus, we may speak of a scientific or a technical term, and of stating things in distinct terms. Thus we say, \"the term minister literally denotes servant;\" \"an exact definition of terms is essential to clearness of thought;\" \"no term of reproach can sufficiently express my indignation;\" \"every art has its peculiar and distinctive terms,\" etc. So also we say, \"purity of style depends on the choice of words, and precision of style on a clear understanding of the terms used.\" Term is chiefly applied to verbs, nouns, and adjectives, these being capable of standing as terms in a logical proposition; while prepositions and conjunctions, which can never be so employed, are rarely spoken of as terms, but simply as words.\n\nTo apply a term to; to name; to call; to denominate. Men term what is beyond the limits of the universe \"imaginary space.\" Locke.

that |1. As a demonstrative pronoun (pl. Those), that usually points out, or refers to, a person or thing previously mentioned, or supposed to be understood. That, as a demonstrative, may precede the noun to which it refers; as, that which he has said is true; those in the basket are good apples. The early fame of Gratian was equal to that of the most celebrated princes. Gibbon. Note: That may refer to an entire sentence or paragraph, and not merely to a word.

And when Moses heard that, he was content. Lev. x. 20. I will know your business, Harry, that I will. Shak. Note: That is often used in opposition to this, or by way of distinction, and in such cases this, like the Latin hic and French ceci, generally refers to that which is nearer, and that, like Latin ille and French cela, to that which is more remote. When they refer to foreign words or phrases, this generally refers to the latter, and that to the former.

It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city. Matt. x. 15. The woman was made whole from that hour. Matt. ix. 22. Note: That was formerly sometimes used with the force of the article the, especially in the phrases that one, that other, which were subsequently corrupted into th'tone, th'tother (now written t'other).

He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame. Prov. ix. 7. A judgment that is equal and impartial must incline to the greater probabilities. Bp. Wilkins. Note: If the relative clause simply conveys an additional idea, and is not properly explanatory or restrictive, who or which (rarely that) is employed; as, the king that (or who) rules well is generally popular; Victoria, who (not that) rules well, enjoys the confidence of her subjects. Ambiguity may in some cases be avoided in the use of that (which is restrictive) instead of who or which, likely to be understood in a coördinating sense. Bain. That was formerly used for that which, as what is now; but such use is now archaic. We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen. John iii. 11. That I have done it is thyself to wite [blame]. Chaucer. That, as a relative pronoun, cannot be governed by a preposition preceding it, but may be governed by one at the end of the sentence which it commences. The ship that somebody was sailing in. Sir W. Scott. In Old English, that was often used with the demonstratives he, his, him, etc., and the two together had the force of a relative pronoun; thus, that he = who; that his = whose; that him = whom. I saw to-day a corpse yborn to church That now on Monday last I saw him wirche [work]. Chaucer. Formerly, that was used, where we now commonly use which, as a relative pronoun with the demonstrative pronoun that as its antecedent. That that dieth, let it die; and that that is to cut off, let it be cut off. Zech. xi. 9. 4. As a conjunction, that retains much of its force as a demonstrative pronoun. It is used, specifically: -- (a) To introduce a clause employed as the object of the preceding verb, or as the subject or predicate nominative of a verb. She tells them 't is a causeless fantasy, And childish error, that they are afraid. Shak. I have shewed before, that a mere possibility to the contrary, can by no means hinder a thing from being highly credible. Bp. Wilkins. (b) To introduce, a reason or cause; -- equivalent to for that, in that, for the reason that, because. He does hear me; And that he does, I weep. Shak. (c) To introduce a purpose; -- usually followed by may, or might, and frequently preceded by so, in order, to the end, etc. These things I say, that ye might be saved. John v. 34. To the end that he may prolong his days. Deut. xvii. 20. (d) To introduce a consequence, result, or effect; -- usually preceded by so or such, sometimes by that. The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings. Milton. He gazed so long That both his eyes were dazzled. Tennyson. (e) To introduce a clause denoting time; -- equivalent to in which time, at which time, when. So wept Duessa until eventide, That shining lamps in Jove's high course were lit. Spenser.
