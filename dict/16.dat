(Elec.) (a) A number of coated jars (Leyden jars) so connected that they may be charged and discharged simultaneously. (b) An apparatus for generating voltaic electricity. Note: In the trough battery, copper and zinc plates, connected in pairs, divide the trough into cells, which are filled with an acid or oxidizing liquid; the effect is exhibited when wires connected with the two end-plates are brought together. In Daniell's battery, the metals are zinc and copper, the former in dilute sulphuric acid, or a solution of sulphate of zinc, the latter in a saturated solution of sulphate of copper. A modification of this is the common gravity battery, so called from the automatic action of the two fluids, which are separated by their specific gravities. In Grove's battery, platinum is the metal used with zinc; two fluids are used, one of them in a porous cell surrounded by the other. In Bunsen's or the carbon battery, the carbon of gas coke is substituted for the platinum of Grove's. In Leclanché's battery, the elements are zinc in a solution of ammonium chloride, and gas carbon surrounded with manganese dioxide in a porous cell. A secondary battery is a battery which usually has the two plates of the same kind, generally of lead, in dilute sulphuric acid, and which, when traversed by an electric current, becomes charged, and is then capable of giving a current of itself for a time, owing to chemical changes produced by the charging current. A storage battery is a kind of secondary battery used for accumulating and storing the energy of electrical charges or currents, usually by means of chemical work done by them; an accumulator. 5.

baume |Designating or conforming to either of the scales used by the French chemist Antoine Baumé in the graduation of his hydrometers; of or relating to Baumé's scales or hydrometers. There are two Baumé hydrometers. One, which is used with liquids heavier than water, sinks to 0º in pure water, and to 15º in a 15 per cent salt solution; the other, for liquids lighter than water, sinks to 0º in a 10 per cent salt solution and to 10º in pure water. In both cases the graduation, based on the distance between these fundamental points, is continued along the stem as far as desired. Since all the degrees on a Baumé scale are thus equal in length, while those on a specific- gravity scale grow smaller as the density increases, there is no simple relation between degrees Bé. and Sp. gr. However, readings on Baumés scale may be approximately reduced to specific gravities by the following formulæ (x in each case being the reading on Baumé's scale) : (a) for liquids heavier than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (144 - x); (b) for liquids lighter than water, sp. gr. = 144 ÷ (134 + x).

To exist in a certain manner or relation, -- whether as a reality or as a product of thought; to exist as the subject of a certain predicate, that is, as having a certain attribute, or as belonging to a certain sort, or as identical with what is specified, -- a word or words for the predicate being annexed; as, to be happy; to be here; to be large, or strong; to be an animal; to be a hero; to be a nonentity; three and two are five; annihilation is the cessation of existence; that is the man. 3.

The seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. Rev. i. 20. Note: The verb to be (including the forms is, was, etc.) is used in forming the passive voice of other verbs; as, John has been struck by James. It is also used with the past participle of many intransitive verbs to express a state of the subject. But have is now more commonly used as the auxiliary, though expressing a different sense; as, \"Ye have come too late -- but ye are come. \" \"The minstrel boy to the war is gone.\" The present and imperfect tenses form, with the infinitive, a particular future tense, which expresses necessity, duty, or purpose; as, government is to be supported; we are to pay our just debts; the deed is to be signed to-morrow. Note: Have or had been, followed by to, implies movement. \"I have been to Paris.\" Sydney Smith. \"Have you been to Franchard \" R. L. Stevenson. Note: Been, or ben, was anciently the plural of the indicative present. \"Ye ben light of the world.\" Wyclif, Matt. v. 14. Afterwards be was used, as in our Bible: \"They that be with us are more than they that be with them.\" 2 Kings vi. 16. Ben was also the old infinitive: \"To ben of such power.\" R. of Gloucester. Be is used as a form of the present subjunctive: \"But if it be a question of words and names.\" Acts xviii. 15. But the indicative forms, is and are, with if, are more commonly used. Be it so, a phrase of supposition, equivalent to suppose it to be so; or of permission, signifying let it be so. Shak. -- If so be, in case. -- To be from, to have come from; as, from what place are you I am from Chicago. -- To let be, to omit, or leave untouched; to let alone. \"Let be, therefore, my vengeance to dissuade.\" Spenser. Syn. -- To be, Exist. The verb to be, except in a few rare case, like that of Shakespeare's \"To be, or not to be\| is used simply as a copula| to connect a subject with its predicate; as| man is mortal; the soul is immortal. The verb to exist is never properly used as a mere copula| but points to things that stand forth| or have a substantive being; as| when the soul is freed from all corporeal alliance| then it truly exists. It is not| therefore| properly synonymous with to be when used as a copula| though occasionally made so by some writers for the sake of variety; as in the phrase \"there exists [is] no reason for laying new taxes.\" We may| indeed| say| \"a friendship has long existed between them|\" instead of saying| \"there has long been a friendship between them;\" but in this case| exist is not a mere copula. It is used in its appropriate sense to mark the friendship as having been long in existence.\n\nA prefix| originally the same word as by; joined with verbs| it serves| (a) To intensify the meaning; as| bespatter| bestir. (b) To render an intransitive verb transitive; as| befall (to fall upon); bespeak (to speak for). (c) To make the action of a verb particular or definite; as| beget (to get as offspring); beset (to set around). Note| It is joined with certain substantives| and a few adjectives| to form verbs; as| bedew| befriend| benight| besot; belate (to make late); belittle (to make little). It also occurs in certain nouns| adverbs| and prepositions| often with something of the force of the preposition by| or about; as| belief (believe)| behalf| bequest (bequeath); because| before| beneath| beside| between. In some words the original force of be is obscured or lost; as| in become| begin| behave| behoove| belong."

beach |1. Pebbles, collectively; shingle. 2. The shore of the sea, or of a lake, which is washed by the waves; especially, a sandy or pebbly shore; the strand.
