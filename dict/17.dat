One may show his munificence in presents of pictures or jewelry, but this would not be beneficence. Benevolence of heart; beneficence of life; munificence in the encouragement of letters.
benevolent |Having a disposition to do good; possessing or manifesting love to mankind, and a desire to promote their prosperity and happiness; disposed to give to good objects; kind; charitable. -- Be*nev\"o*lent*ly, adv. Syn. -- Benevolent, Beneficent. Etymologically considered, benevolent implies wishing well to others, and beneficent, doing well. But by degrees the word benevolent has been widened to include not only feelings, but actions; thus, we speak of benevolent operations, benevolent labors for the public good, benevolent societies. In like manner, beneficent is now often applied to feelings; thus, we speak of the beneficent intentions of a donor. This extension of the terms enables us to mark nicer shades of meaning. Thus, the phrase \"benevolent labors\" turns attention to the source of these labors, viz., benevolent feeling; while beneficent would simply mark them as productive of good. So, \"beneficent intentions\" point to the feelings of the donor as bent upon some specific good act; while \"benevolent intentions\" would only denote a general wish and design to do good.

Bias is literally a weight fixed on one side of a ball used in bowling, and causing it to swerve from a straight course.
