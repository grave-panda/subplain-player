will |1. The power of choosing; the faculty or endowment of the soul by which it is capable of choosing; the faculty or power of the mind by which we decide to do or not to do; the power or faculty of preferring or selecting one of two or more objects. It is necessary to form a distinct notion of what is meant by the word \"volition\" in order to understand the import of the word will, for this last word expresses the power of mind of which \"volition\" is the act. Stewart. Will is an ambiguous word, being sometimes put for the faculty of willing; sometimes for the act of that faculty, besides [having] other meanings. But \"volition\" always signifies the act of willing, and nothing else. Reid. Appetite is the will's solicitor, and the will is appetite's controller; what we covet according to the one, by the other we often reject. Hooker. The will is plainly that by which the mind chooses anything. J. Edwards. 2. The choice which is made; a determination or preference which results from the act or exercise of the power of choice; a volition. The word \"will,\" however, is not always used in this its proper acceptation, but is frequently substituted for \"volition\| as when I say that my hand mover in obedience to my will. Stewart. 3. The choice or determination of one who has authority; a decree; a command; discretionary pleasure. Thy will be done. Matt. vi. 10. Our prayers should be according to the will of God. Law. 4. Strong wish or inclination; desire; purpose. Note| \"Inclination is another word with which will is frequently confounded. Thus| when the apothecary says| in Romeo and Juliet| -- My poverty| but not my will| consents; . . . Put this in any liquid thing you will| And drink it off. the word will is plainly used as| synonymous with inclination; not in the strict logical sense| as the immediate antecedent of action. It is with the same latitude that the word is used in common conversation| when we speak of doing a thing which duty prescribes| against one's own will; or when we speak of doing a thing willingly or unwillingly.\" Stewart. 5. That which is strongly wished or desired. What's your will| good friar Shak. The mariner hath his will. Coleridge. 6. Arbitrary disposal; power to control| dispose| or determine. Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies. Ps. xxvii. 12. 7 7 (Law)  The legal declaration of a person's mind as to the manner in which he would have his property or estate disposed of after his death; the written instrument| legally executed| by which a man makes disposition of his estate| to take effect after his death; testament; devise. See the Note under Testament| 1. Note| Wills are written or nuncupative| that is| oral. See Nuncupative will| under Nuncupative. At will (Law)| at pleasure. To hold an estate at the will of another| is to enjoy the possession at his pleasure| and be liable to be ousted at any time by the lessor or proprietor. An estate at will is at the will of both parties. -- Good will. See under Good. -- Ill will| enmity; unfriendliness; malevolence. -- To have one's will| to obtain what is desired; to do what one pleases. -- Will worship| worship according to the dictates of the will or fancy; formal worship. [Obs.] -- Will worshiper| one who offers will worship. [Obs.] Jer. Taylor. -- With a will| with willingness and zeal; with all one's heart or strength; earnestly; heartily.\n\n1. To wish; to desire; to incline to have. A wife as of herself no thing ne sholde [should] Wille in effect| but as her husband wolde [would]. Chaucer. Caleb said unto her| What will thou Judg. i. 14. They would none of my counsel. Prov. i. 30. 2. As an auxiliary| will is used to denote futurity dependent on the verb. Thus| in first person| \"I will\" denotes willingness| consent| promise; and when \"will\" is emphasized| it denotes determination or fixed purpose; as| I will go if you wish; I will go at all hazards. In the second and third persons| the idea of distinct volition| wish| or purpose is evanescent| and simple certainty is appropriately expressed; as| \"You will go|\" or \"He will go|\" describes a future event as a fact only. To emphasize will denotes (according to the tone or context) certain futurity or fixed determination. Note| Will| auxiliary| may be used elliptically for will go. \"I'll to her lodgings.\" Marlowe. Note| As in shall (which see)| the second and third persons may be virtually converted into the first| either by question or indirect statement| so as to receive the meaning which belongs to will in that person; thus| \"Will you go\" (answer| \"I will go\") asks assent| requests| etc.; while \"Will he go\" simply inquires concerning futurity; thus| also|\"He says or thinks he will go|\" \"You say or think you will go|\" both signify willingness or consent. Note| Would| as the preterit of will| is chiefly employed in conditional| subjunctive| or optative senses; as| he would go if he could; he could go if he would; he said that he would go; I would fain go| but can not; I would that I were young again; and other like phrases. In the last use| the first personal pronoun is often omitted; as| would that he were here; would to Heaven that it were so; and| omitting the to in such an adjuration. \"Would God I had died for thee.\" Would is used for both present and future time| in conditional propositions| and would have for past time; as| he would go now if he were ready; if it should rain| he would not go; he would have gone| had he been able. Would not| as also will not| signifies refusal. \"He was angry| and would not go in.\" Luke xv. 28. Would is never a past participle. Note| In Ireland| Scotland| and the United States| especially in the southern and western portions of the United States| shall and will| should and would| are often misused| as in the following examples| -- I am able to devote as much time and attention to other subjects as I will [shall] be under the necessity of doing next winter. Chalmers. A countryman| telling us what he had seen| remarked that if the conflagration went on| as it was doing| we would [should] have| as our next season's employment| the Old Town of Edinburgh to rebuild. H. Miller. I feel assured that I will [shall] not have the misfortune to find conflicting views held by one so enlightened as your excellency. J. Y. Mason.\n\nTo be willing; to be inclined or disposed; to be pleased; to wish; to desire. And behold| there came a leper and worshiped him| saying| Lord if thou wilt| thou canst make me clean. And Jesus . . . touched him| saying| I will; be thou clean. Matt. viii. 2| 3. Note| This word has been confused with will| v. i.| to choose| which| unlike this| is of the weak conjugation. Will I| nill I| or Will ye| hill ye| or Will he| nill he| whether I| you| or he will it or not; hence| without choice; compulsorily; -- sometimes corrupted into willy nilly. \"If I must take service willy nilly.\" J. H. Newman. \"Land for all who would till it| and reading and writing will ye| nill ye.\" Lowell.\n\n1. To form a distinct volition of; to determine by an act of choice; to ordain; to decree. \"What she will to do or say.\" Milton. By all law and reason| that which the Parliament will not| is no more established in this kingdom. Milton. Two things he [God] willeth| that we should be good| and that we should be happy. Barrow. 2. To enjoin or command| as that which is determined by an act of volition; to direct; to order. [Obs. or R.] They willed me say so| madam. Shak. Send for music| And will the cooks to use their best of cunning To please the palate. Beau. & Fl. As you go| will the lord mayor . . . To attend our further pleasure presently. J. Webster. 3. To give or direct the disposal of by testament; to bequeath; to devise; as| to will one's estate to a child; also| to order or direct by testament; as| he willed that his nephew should have his watch.\n\nTo exercise an act of volition; to choose; to decide; to determine; to decree. At Winchester he lies| so himself willed. Robert of Brunne. He that shall turn his thoughts inward upon what passes in his own mind when he wills. Locke. I contend for liberty as it signifies a power in man to do as he wills or pleases. Collins."

The quality of being wise; knowledge, and the capacity to make due use of it; knowledge of the best ends and the best means; discernment and judgment; discretion; sagacity; skill; dexterity.

Wisdom has been defined to be \"the use of the best means for attaining the best ends.\" \"We conceive,\" says Whewell, \" prudence as the virtue by which we select right means for given ends, while wisdom implies the selection of right ends as well as of right means.\" Hence, wisdom implies the union of high mental and moral excellence. Prudence (that is, providence, or forecast) is of a more negative character; it rather consists in avoiding danger than in taking decisive measures for the accomplishment of an object. Sir Robert Walpole was in many respects a prudent statesman, but he was far from being a wise one. Burke has said that prudence, when carried too far, degenerates into a \"reptile virtue,\" which is the more dangerous for its plausible appearance. Knowledge, a more comprehensive term, signifies the simple apprehension of facts or relations. \"In strictness of language,\" says Paley, \" there is a difference between knowledge and wisdom; wisdom always supposing action, and action directed by it.\" Knowledge and wisdom, far from being one, Have ofttimes no connection. Knowledge dwells In heads replete with thoughts of other men; Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own. Knowledge, a rude, unprofitable mass, The mere materials with which wisdom builds, Till smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its place, Does but encumber whom it seems to enrich. Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much; Wisdom is humble that he knows no more. Cowper. Wisdom tooth, the last, or back, tooth of the full set on each half of each jaw in man; -- familiarly so called, because appearing comparatively late, after the person may be supposed to have arrived at the age of wisdom. See the Note under Tooth, 1.

Note: This verb is now used only in the infinitive, to wit, which is employed, especially in legal language, to call attention to a particular thing, or to a more particular specification of what has preceded, and is equivalent to namely, that is to say.\n\n1. Mind; intellect; understanding; sense. Who knew the wit of the Lord or who was his counselor Wyclif (Rom. xi. 34). A prince most prudent, of an excellent And unmatched wit and judgment. Shak. Will puts in practice what wit deviseth. Sir J. Davies. He wants not wit the dander to decline. Dryden. 2. A mental faculty, or power of the mind; -- used in this sense chiefly in the plural, and in certain phrases; as, to lose one's wits; at one's wits' end, and the like. \"Men's wittes ben so dull.\" Chaucer. I will stare him out of his wits. Shak. 3. Felicitous association of objects not usually connected, so as to produce a pleasant surprise; also. the power of readily combining objects in such a manner. The definition of wit is only this, that it is a propriety of thoughts and words; or, in other terms, thoughts and words elegantly adapted to the subject. Dryden. Wit which discovers partial likeness hidden in general diversity. Coleridge.

Milton. Intemperate wits will spare neither friend nor foe. L'Estrange. A wit herself, Amelia weds a wit. Young.

But my five wits nor my five senses can Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee. Shak. Syn. -- Ingenuity; humor; satire; sarcasm; irony; burlesque. -- Wit, Humor. Wit primarily meant mind; and now denotes the power of seizing on some thought or occurrence, and, by a sudden turn, presenting it under aspects wholly new and unexpected -- apparently natural and admissible, if not perfectly just, and bearing on the subject, or the parties concerned, with a laughable keenness and force. \"What I want,\" said a pompous orator, aiming at his antagonist, \"is common sense.\" \"Exactly!\" was the whispered reply. The pleasure we find in wit arises from the ingenuity of the turn, the sudden surprise it brings, and the patness of its application to the case, in the new and ludicrous relations thus flashed upon the view. Humor is a quality more congenial to the English mind than wit. It consists primarily in taking up the peculiarities of a humorist (or eccentric person) and drawing them out, as Addison did those of Sir Roger de Coverley, so that we enjoy a hearty, good-natured laugh at his unconscious manifestation of whims and oddities. From this original sense the term has been widened to embrace other sources of kindly mirth of the same general character. In a well-known caricature of English reserve, an Oxford student is represented as standing on the brink of a river, greatly agitated at the sight of a drowning man before him, and crying out, \"O that I had been introduced to this gentleman, that I might save his life! The, \"Silent Woman\" of Ben Jonson is one of the most humorous productions, in the original sense of the term, which we have in our language.
