naperian |Of, pertaining to, or discovered by, Napier, or Naper. Naperian logarithms. See under Logarithms. NAPIER'S BONES; NAPIER'S RODS Na\"pi*er's bones`, Na\"pi*er's rods`.  A set of rods, made of bone or other material, each divided into nine spaces, and containing the numbers of a column of the multiplication table; -- a contrivance of Baron Napier, the inventor of logarithms, for facilitating the operations of multiplication and division.
napery |Table linen; also, linen clothing, or linen in general. [Obs.] Gayton.
napha water |A perfume distilled from orange flowers.
naphew |See Navew.
naphtha |1. (Chem.)  The complex mixture of volatile, liquid, inflammable hydrocarbons, occurring naturally, and usually called crude petroleum, mineral oil, or rock oil. Specifically: That portion of the distillate obtained in the refinement of petroleum which is intermediate between the lighter gasoline and the heavier benzine, and has a specific gravity of about 0.7, -- used as a solvent for varnishes, as a carburetant, illuminant, etc. 2. (Chem.)  One of several volatile inflammable liquids obtained by the distillation of certain carbonaceous materials and resembling the naphtha from petroleum; as, Boghead naphtha, from Boghead coal (obtained at Boghead, Scotland); crude naphtha, or light oil, from coal tar; wood naphtha, from wood, etc. Note: This term was applied by the earlier chemical writers to a number of volatile, strong smelling, inflammable liquids, chiefly belonging to the ethers, as the sulphate, nitrate, or acetate of ethyl. Watts. Naphtha vitrioli Etym: [NL., naphtha of vitriol] (Old Chem.), common ethyl ether; -- formerly called sulphuric ether. See Ether.
naphthalate |A salt of naphthalic acid; a phthalate. [Obs.]
naphthalene |A white crystalline aromatic hydrocarbon, C10H8, analogous to benzene, and obtained by the distillation of certain bituminous materials, such as the heavy oil of coal tar. It is the type and basis of a large number of derivatives among organic compounds. Formerly called also naphthaline. Naphthalene red (Chem.), a dyestuff obtained from certain diazo derivatives of naphthylamine, and called also magdala red. -- Naphthalene yellow (Chem.), a yellow dyestuff obtained from certain nitro derivatives of naphthol.
naphthalenic |Pertaining to , or derived from, naphthalene; -- used specifically to designate a yellow crystalline substance, called naphthalenic acid and also hydroxy quinone, and obtained from certain derivatives of naphthol.
naphthalic |(a) Pertaining to, derived from, or related to, naphthalene; -- used specifically to denote any one of a series of acids derived from naphthalene, and called naphthalene acids. (b) Formerly, designating an acid probably identical with phthalic acid.
naphthalidine |Same as Naphthylamine.
naphthalin |See Naphthalene.
naphthaline |See Naphthalene.
naphthalize |To mingle, saturate, or impregnate, with naphtha.
naphthazarin |A dyestuff, resembling alizarin, obtained from naphthoquinone as a red crystalline substance with a bright green, metallic luster; -- called also naphthalizarin.
naphthene |A peculiar hydrocarbon occuring as an ingredient of Caucasian petroleum.
naphthide |A compound of naphthalene or its radical with a metallic element; as, mercuric naphthide.
naphthoic |Pertaining to, derived from, or related to, naphthalene; -- used specifically to designate any one of a series of carboxyl derivatives, called naphthoic acids.
naphthol |Any one of a series of hydroxyl derivatives of naphthalene, analogous to phenol. In general they are crystalline substances with a phenol (carbolic) odor. Naphthol blue, Naphthol orange, Naphthol yellow (Chem.), brilliant dyestuffs produced from certain complex nitrogenous derivatives of naphthol or naphthoquinone.
naphthoquinone |A yellow crystalline substance, C10H6O2, analogous to quinone, obtained by oxidizing naphthalene with chromic acid.
naphthyl |A hydrocarbon radical regarded as the essential residue of naphthalene.
naphthylamine |One of two basic amido derivatives of naphthalene, C10H7.NH2, forming crystalline solids.
napierian |Of, pertaining to, or discovered by, Napier, or Naper. Naperian logarithms. See under Logarithms. NAPIER'S BONES; NAPIER'S RODS Na\"pi*er's bones`, Na\"pi*er's rods`.  A set of rods, made of bone or other material, each divided into nine spaces, and containing the numbers of a column of the multiplication table; -- a contrivance of Baron Napier, the inventor of logarithms, for facilitating the operations of multiplication and division.
napiform |Turnip-shaped; large and round in the upper part, and very slender below.
napkin |1. A little towel, or small cloth, esp. one for wiping the fingers and mouth at table. 2. A handkerchief. [Obs.] Shak. Napkin pattern. See Linen scroll, under Linen. -- Napkin ring, a ring of metal, ivory, or other material, used to inclose a table napkin.
